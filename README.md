## 1. Project Overview
This project is a full-stack Document Intake Web Application designed to simulate a real-world enterprise system for managing business documents.  
The system allows users to:
- Submit, track, update, retrieve, and logically delete documents through a web-based interface.  
- The backend is built using core Node.js and follows a layered architecture that separates routing, controller logic, business logic, data persistence, and utility services.  
- The frontend communicates with the backend exclusively through RESTful APIs using the Fetch API.
